# EthosEngine
The project is focus on the ethical aspects of speech.

# Objective:

The objective of the “SentinelSpeak” project is to develop a robust and efficient machine learning model for 
the classification of hate speech in digital communication. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries
such as NLTK and SpaCy, and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the project aims to accurately 
identify and categorize offensive language, thereby fostering healthier online interactions. The ultimate goal is 
to contribute to the creation of safer digital spaces by mitigating the impact of harmful language.
